# Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks

In this project, I will analyze data from the stock market for some technology stocks. 

I will use Pandas to extract and analyze the information, visualize it, and look at different ways to analyze the risk of a stock, based on its performance history. 

Here are the questions we'll try to answer:

- What was the change in a stock's price over time?
- What was the daily return average of a stock?
- What was the moving average of various stocks?
- What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
- How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
- How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?
